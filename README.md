# Simple React App with Vite

This is a template repository for creating a simple React application using Vite. Vite is a fast development build tool that provides near-instantaneous builds and hot module replacement, making it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping and small to medium-sized projects.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or above)
- npm (v7.0.0 or above)

## Getting Started

To use this template, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Aliabdo6/get-advice
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd simple-react-app-vite
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and open your app in the browser. Any changes you make to your code will be automatically reflected in the browser without requiring a full page reload.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy these files to a web server or a hosting service of your choice.

## Additional Configuration

If you need to customize the configuration of your Vite app, you can modify the `vite.config.js` file. Refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information on available configuration options.

## Folder Structure

The template repository follows a basic folder structure:

```
simple-react-app-vite/
  ├── dist/                  # Build output directory
  ├── node_modules/          # Installed dependencies
  ├── public/                # Static assets
  │   ├── index.html         # HTML template
  ├── src/                   # Source code
  │   ├── App.jsx            # Main application component
  │   └── index.jsx          # Entry point
  ├── .gitignore             # Git ignore file
  ├── package.json           # Project metadata and dependencies
  ├── README.md              # Project readme (you're reading it!)
  └── vite.config.js         # Vite configuration
```

Feel free to modify the folder structure according to your project requirements.
